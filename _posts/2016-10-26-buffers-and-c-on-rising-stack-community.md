It's been a few months since I've posted to this blog and I  wanted to link to an article  I've been working on that just appeared on [Rising Stack's new Community blog](https://community.risingstack.com/).  The article - [Using Buffers to share data between Node.js and C++](https://community.risingstack.com/using-buffers-node-js-c-plus-plus/) is all about making use of Buffers to efficiently move data between JavaScript and C++ - including asynchronous addons with worker threads..

The post has some examples also found in my book -[C++ and Node.js Integration] (http://scottfrees.com/ebooks/nodecpp/), but it includes a few **new examples** that I think show the basics a little more clearly.

Be sure to [check it out](https://community.risingstack.com/using-buffers-node-js-c-plus-plus/)!
