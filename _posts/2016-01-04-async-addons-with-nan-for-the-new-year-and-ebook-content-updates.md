Happy New Year everyone!  Last month I let you all know I was starting a blog series about [Getting C++ to the Web using Node.js](/getting-your-c-to-the-web-with-node-js).  My plan was to get the whole series out by the end of the year, and I *just* made it!  The last part was posted just a couple of days ago, it focused on [asynchronous addons using Nan](/building-an-asynchronous-c-addon-for-node-js-using-nan). I also covered [automation](/automating-a-c-program-from-a-node-js-web-app) and [shared libraries](/calling-native-c-dlls-from-a-node-js-web-app) along the way.

If you were here in the last day or so, you might have already read the post on asynchronous addons using Nan. I just added some build scripts last night to make getting the tutorial up and running more painless though - so you might want to take a look at the [repository](https://github.com/freezer333/cppwebify-tutorial) again.

Many of you spread the word about these posts (**thank you so much**!) and I’ve had a bunch of new signups for my upcoming [C++/Node.js integration book](/book/). I’m working hard to bring together the material.  In the meantime, I’d really like to get feedback from you all about specifically what you are looking for.  The tentative table of contents is listed [here](/book/), but **if I’ve missed something important to you - please leave a comment below**.  I’d also really appreciate it if you share it with your colleagues - the more feedback the better!
 
Later this month I’ll have some more posts about Node integration, based on some of the questions I’ve already received (i.e. streaming data from C++ and dealing with Local vs. Persistent memory in V8).
 
Until then - I hope everyone has a great start to their New Year!
