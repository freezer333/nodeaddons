  <h1>The Addon Cheatsheet</h1>
  <p>Welcome!  This is a quick guide-sheet to get you started with Node.js C++ addons.  It's meant to be super-easy to skim and copy/paste into your code.  If you are looking for more explanation and depth, checkout the <b>blog</b>, the full <b>code tutorial</b>, the <b>book</b>, or best of all... <b> the complete video course</b>.

  <h2>package.json</h2>
  <p>Use this when you are creating an addon so it will get built by npm install.</p>

  <h2>bindings.gyp</h2>
  <p>Setup your course code in a c++ directory and configure for NAN</p>

  <h2>NAN boilerplate for addon methods</h2>
  <p>Start adding as many functions as you want...</p>

  <h2>Converting data from JavaScript to C++ types</h2>
  <p>Use NAN to work with JavaScript inputs in C++</p>

  <h2>Moving C++ data back to JavaScript (synchronously)</h2>
  <p>Use this for short functions that will return data right away</p>

  <h2>Async boilerplate</h2>
  <p>Use this pattern to build asynchronous addons that return data via callbacks</p>

  <h2>Buffers</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h2>Including boost libraries</h2>

  <h2>Prebuilt Addons</h2>
